				<h2>LiveNotes!</h2>
				<p class="">
					LiveNotes! is an android application directed towards improving the class room experience by providing instant feedback to the instructors. The application focuses on unobtrusive, easy to read, signals that allow instructors to monitor the current state of the students and whether the lessons need to be adjusted for the audience (an example being if something needs to be repeated or if the instructor is being too quiet). The range of the application is from kindergarten to college classrooms as well as seminars and other similar events.
